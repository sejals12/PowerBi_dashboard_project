# PowerBi_dashboard_project
The objective of the dashboard is to create interactive visualizations to provide useful insights to stakeholders. This help us to understand about revenue generated on sales of various products.
I made a interactive Report using Microsoft Power BI by taking dataset of Adventure Works Cycles.
Here the process involves : ETL, DAX functions (Yoy, Mom, SUMX, CALCULATE, AVERAGE, Cross fliter, RELATED, DISTINCT COUNT), Data Modelling, Managing Relationships etc.
